# How many Kilobytes are 2,5MB?
Decimal units such as kilobyte (KB), megabyte (MB), and gigabyte (GB) are commonly used to express the size of data. Working in the IT means, that we are always have to work with these fingures. This program is just a simple python implementation to present the figures in the various units.

For more details about the binary and decimal units please take a look to the information presetred by [IBM]([Comparison of binary and decimal units and values](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/storage-insights?topic=overview-units-measurement-storage-data))
